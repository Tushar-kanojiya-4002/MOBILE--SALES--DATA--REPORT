## Project Overview

This project involves analyzing mobile phone sales data and generating an interactive Power BI report/dashboard to provide insights on sales trends, product performance, and other KPIs. The goal is to transform raw data into meaningful visualizations and actionable business insights.

---

## Dataset

- Filename: `Mobile Sales Data.xlsx`  
- Contents: Sales transactions data including details such as date, product, amount, quantity, payment type, etc.  
- Source: (You can mention where you got it — internal data, Kaggle, etc.)  
- Data size: (mention number of rows / records)  

---

## Tools & Technologies

- **Power BI Desktop** (for data modeling, DAX, visualization)  
- **Excel** (for initial data inspection / cleaning)  
- Possibly **Power Query / Power BI’s transformation tools**  
- (Optionally) other tools / libraries you used (e.g. data cleaning in Python, etc.)

## Project Workflow / Steps Performed

Below is a general outline of the steps you would have (or should have) taken to develop this report. Please adjust based on your exact process.

| Step | Description |
|---|-------------|
| 1. Data Loading | Imported the Excel dataset into Power BI. |
| 2. Data Cleaning & Transformation | Handled missing values, removed duplicates, formatted data types (dates, numeric fields), and renamed columns. |
| 3. Data Modeling | Created relationships (if multiple tables), defined primary keys or linking keys, set up star schema (fact and dimension tables) if needed. |
| 4. Creating Calculated Columns / Measures | Used DAX to define new columns (e.g. Year, Month, Day of Week) and measures (e.g. Total Sales, Profit, Quantity Sold). |
| 5. Building Visuals / Dashboard | Created charts, tables, cards, slicers, filters to display trends and allow user interactivity. |
| 6. Interactivity & Drill-down | Added drill-downs, tooltips, filters / slicers so users can explore by date, product category, region, etc. |
| 7. Layout & Styling | Adjusted report layout, color themes, formatting to make the dashboard polished and easy to read. |
| 8. Validation & Testing | Verified that the metrics are correct (cross-checking sums etc.), and tested filters and interactions. |
| 9. Export / Publish | Saved the `.pbix` file, and (if applicable) published to Power BI service or shared the report with stakeholders. |

## Report / Dashboard Features & Visuals

Here are some of the key visuals and features likely present or that you could include:

- **Cards / KPI tiles** showing total sales, total profit, total units sold  
- **Time-series charts** (line / area charts) showing sales over months or years  
- **Bar charts / Column charts** for product-wise sales, payment type distribution  
- **Pie / Donut charts** to show share by category or payment method  
- **Slicers / filters** (by year, product, region, payment type)  
- **Drill-through / drill-down** capability (e.g. click on year → view monthly data)  
- **Tooltips / hover details**  
- **Tables / Matrix visuals** for detailed breakdowns  

---

## Key Insights & Findings

(Here, you present the business insights you discovered. Example areas might include:)

- Which product(s) had the highest sales / revenue  
- Which payment method was most common / generated highest revenue  
- Monthly / seasonal trends — peak months and low months  
- Year-over-year growth or decline  
- Any anomalies or unexpected patterns (e.g. unusually high sales in a particular month)  

You should summarize 3–5 key insights that someone viewing your report can immediately glean.

## How to Use / View the Report

1. Open the `mobile SALES DATA PROJECT POWER BI 111.pbix` file in Power BI Desktop.  
2. Use the slicers and filters on the report pages to explore different views (by year, product, payment method, etc.).  
3. You can publish the `.pbix` to Power BI Service (if you have a Power BI account) and share the interactive report online.  
4. Ensure the data source (Excel file) is located in accessible location so that on refresh, it loads successfully.

## Future Enhancements

- Add **forecasting / trend prediction** (using built-in Power BI forecasting or custom analytics)  
- Incorporate **geographic analysis** (if location data available)  
- Improve performance by optimizing the DAX / data model  
- Add more detailed **customer segmentation / cohort analysis**  
- Automate **data refresh** (if the dataset updates)  
- Deploy in Power BI Service with scheduled refreshes and sharing  
- Add **mobile-friendly layout** for viewing on phones / tablets

Feel free to adjust this structure and content to match exactly what you did. If you tell me more details (e.g. which DAX formulas you used, visuals you built, number of records etc.), I can refine this README further for your repo. Do you want me to generate the final README Markdown file prepared for your repo with actual values filled?
